								<h2 id="text01">About Me</h2>
								<p id="text02"><span>I&#39;m a US citizen permanently residing in Northern Ireland. I came to the UK in 2009, when I went to England for &quot;six months&quot; to provide software support as a Senior Software Developer working for Protolabs. That arrangement worked very well, so Protolabs sponsored a work visa to allow me to stay and work in the UK for an extended period. Ten years later, I&#39;m now happily married, a permanent UK resident, and living in an incredibly beautiful part of the world.</span><br /><br /><span>After a few years in England, I was asked to recruit and manage a team of software developers there. During my tenure as a Software Development Manager, I learned a lot about Agile practices and principles, delivering excellent software with a geographically dispersed team, and becoming a leader to an incredibly talented group of people with diverse skills and experience levels. During that time, I also began studying for my MSc in Software and Systems Security at University of Oxford.</span><br /><br /><span>In mid-2016, I became Information Security Manager and began building the global Enterprise Security team. We planned to build a team of Security Analysts and Engineers to establish security policies and procedures, manage security incidents, implement a secure software development life cycle, raise security awareness, improve security monitoring, manage vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security frameworks. A senior leadership change and subsequent budget constraints, however, meant working toward those goals with very limited resources.</span><br /><br /><span>I left Protolabs in November 2018, as personal circumstances meant that we needed to be closer to family in County Down, Northern Ireland. Now I&#39;m working to establish <a href="https://computerhelpni.co.uk/">Computer Help Northern Ireland</a>, to provide mobile computer support in County Down.</span></p>
